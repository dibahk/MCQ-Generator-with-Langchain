Ninja's 8-inch Chef’s Knife is an all-around great knife. The rounded handle is comfortable, and the knife is well-balanced, making it easy to handle. The stainless steel blade is tough and holds an edge well. I've been using this knife daily for two months and felt the need to sharpen it only twice. There are more-expensive knives in this guide that are better in some ways, but for most people this is the best combination of quality and price.

Take the money you save buying this and invest in a good sharpener. Ninja sells this knife with a sharpener for $90 (separately, the sharpener is $50, so you save a little), but I haven't tested it. If you're a beginner, I suggest the simplicity of a two-stage electric sharpener like the Presto EverSharp ($45 at Amazon). If you know how to sharpen with a stone, I like Shapton’s medium grit (1,000) ceramic stone ($50 at Amazon). If you've never used a stone, fear not; it's not that difficult. YouTube is full of videos to get you started, but I really enjoy Ryky Tran's Burrfection guides.

Another Option
Victorinox's Fibrox Pro for $55: Our former top pick is still a great knife. It doesn't have the same high-quality construction as the Ninja (the Victorinox’s handle is plastic), but it does have a nearly nonstick finish—hardly anything sticks to this blade, not even fresh cilantro. If the Ninja doesn't strike your fancy, this is also a great knife.
